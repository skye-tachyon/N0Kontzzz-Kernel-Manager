- **Process Monitor**  
  Real-time task manager that monitors CPU and RAM usage across all system and user processes. Features precise CPU delta calculation via `/proc` parsing, factual RAM usage (RSS) in MB, and advanced filtering options to distinguish between User and System/Root applications. Includes customizable sample rates and sorting capabilities.

- **Thermal Management**  
  Access to system thermal zone data for in-depth debugging and monitoring of device temperature profiles.

- **Performance Mode**
  Quickly toggle between system-wide performance presets tailored for different usage scenarios.
  - **Balanced**: Employs the `schedutil` governor for an optimal balance between system responsiveness and power efficiency.
  - **Performance**: Locks CPU clusters to the `performance` governor for maximum throughput and zero latency during intensive tasks.
  - **Powersave**: Switches to the `powersave` governor to minimize energy consumption and extend battery life. *Note: This mode is only functional if your kernel includes the `powersave` governor.*

- **CPU Performance Tuning**
  Comprehensive control over CPU scaling behaviors.
  - **Cluster Control**: Adjust Min/Max frequencies for Little, Big, and Prime clusters independently.
  - **Governor Selection**: Manually switch between all available kernel governors for fine-grained tuning.

- **GPU Control**
  Fine-tune graphics processing unit settings for gaming or efficiency.
  - **Frequency Scaling**: Set minimum and maximum GPU frequencies to cap performance or force high speeds.
  - **Governor Management**: Choose GPU governors (e.g., `simple_ondemand`) to dictate how the GPU ramps up clock speeds under load.
  - **Power Levels**: Configure GPU power throttling levels to manage heat generation during intense gaming sessions.

- **RAM & Memory Management**
  Advanced tools to optimize system memory usage and multitasking.
  - **ZRAM Config**: Monitor ZRAM usage and compression algorithms (e.g., LZ4, ZSTD) to maximize available memory.
  - **Virtual Memory (VM) Tweaks**: Adjust `swappiness`, `dirty_ratio`, and `vfs_cache_pressure` to control how aggressively the system swaps data and caches files.
  - **Low Memory Killer (LMK)**: View and tune LMK parameters to keep critical apps alive in the background.

- **Modern User Interface**
  Designed with the latest Jetpack Compose and Material Design 3 Expressive components for a cohesive and intuitive user experience.
  - **Dynamic Theming**: Support for Light, Dark, and System-adaptive themes.
  - **AMOLED Mode**: Pure black background optimization for OLED displays to maximize power savings in dark mode.
  - **Customizable Notification Icon**: Choose between live battery percentage, app logo, or a transparent icon for a cleaner status bar.
  - **Multi-language Support**: Fully localized in English and Indonesian.
  - **Permission Manager**: Transparently view and verify all critical system permissions requested by the application, including Root access and Usage statistics.
- **Intelligent Backup & Restore**
  Securely manage your application configurations with built-in safety mechanisms and granular control.
  - **Granular Management**: Selectively backup or restore specific categories including System Tuning, Network & Storage, Battery & Charging, or general UI preferences.
  - **Compatibility Guard**: The application performs strict validation during the restore process. It checks every setting (governors, frequencies, etc.) against the current kernel's capabilities. Unsupported values are safely skipped to prevent system instability or bootloops.
  - **Instant Application**: Restored settings are applied to the system nodes immediately upon completion, ensuring the device state matches your backup without requiring a reboot.
  - **Secure Storage**: Leverages the Android Storage Access Framework (SAF) for secure, user-granted file access to local storage.

- **Efficient Architecture**  
  Built on a lightweight MVVM architecture to ensure optimal performance and minimal resource usage on rooted devices.

- **Per-App Profiles**
  Automate your device's behavior by creating custom profiles that activate when specific applications are in the foreground.
  - **Performance Mode Integration**: Assign `Balanced`, `Performance`, or `Powersave` modes to specific apps.
  - **Graphics Optimization**: Toggle `KGSL Skip Pool Zeroing` for specific games to boost FPS.
  - **Battery Protection**: Automatically enable `Bypass Charging` for intensive apps to prevent battery wear and heat.

- **Bypass Charging**  
  Directly power the device from the AC adapter while pausing battery charging. This effectively minimizes heat buildup during intensive workloads and extends overall battery health. *Note: This feature requires kernel support.*

- **Charging Control**  
  Automates the charging cycle by stopping at a user-defined percentage and resuming when the battery drops to a lower level.  
  *Note: This feature requires **Battery Monitor** to be enabled and a kernel that supports **Bypass Charging** (as they utilize the same control node). To maximize power efficiency, the automation logic piggybacks on the Battery Monitor's existing background polling cycle rather than running a separate service.*

- **Force Fast Charge**  
  Forces the device to charge at a faster rate by increasing the charging current limits. Use with caution as it may increase heat buildup. *Note: This feature requires kernel support.*

- **KGSL Skip Pool Zeroing**  
  Optimizes Adreno GPU memory management by skipping the zero-initialization of memory pages, resulting in reduced overhead and improved graphical performance. *Note: This feature requires kernel support.*

- **TCP Congestion Control**
  Optimize network data throughput by selecting from available TCP congestion control algorithms (e.g., BBR, Cubic, Reno). Custom selections are persisted and automatically reapplied on boot.

- **I/O Scheduler Tuning**
  Optimize storage read/write performance by choosing the most suitable kernel I/O scheduler for your workload. Preferences are saved and restored on system startup.

- **Dexopt (App Optimization)**
  Manually trigger Android's Dalvik Executable Optimization process to improve application launch speeds and overall system smoothness.
  - **Speed Profile Compilation**: Compiles applications based on usage profiles for faster execution.
  - **Layout Compilation**: Optimizes view hierarchies to reduce UI rendering latency.
  - **Background Dexopt**: Executes the system's background maintenance optimization script immediately.

  Required for the **Dexopt** feature to execute and monitor system-level package optimization commands.

- **Usage Access (`android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`)**  
  Required for the **Per-App Profiles** feature to detect which application is currently in the foreground and apply the corresponding system profile.

- **Storage Access (`android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`)**  
  Used to backup and restore application configurations, profiles, and logs.

- **Query All Packages (`android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`)**  
  Necessary for listing installed applications when creating new per-app profiles.

- **Battery Optimization (`android.permission.REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`)**  
  Ensures the background monitoring service remains active to reliably apply profiles and track battery statistics without being killed by the system.

- **Vibration (`android.permission.VIBRATE`)**  
  Used to provide tactile haptic feedback when interacting with UI elements like sliders, enhancing the user experience.

- **Notifications (`android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS`)**  
  Required to display persistent status notifications for background services like the Battery Monitor and Thermal Service.

- **Boot Completed (`android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`)**  
  Allows the application to automatically initialize services and re-apply saved kernel profiles immediately after the device restarts.

- **Foreground Service (`android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE`)**  
  Ensures critical monitoring services (Battery, App Monitor) continue running reliably in the background without being terminated by the system.
